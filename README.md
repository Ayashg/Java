Car Rental System Documentation
1. Introduction
The Car Rental System is a software application designed to facilitate the management of car rentals, customers, and rental transactions. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, the system provides a modular approach to managing various entities involved in car rental services.

2. Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to reinforce OOP concepts and enhance programming skills through the design and implementation of a real-world application. It serves as a learning tool for both students and developers interested in understanding the dynamics of an object-oriented system.

3. Features
Car Management: Allows for the addition, removal, and updating of car details, including availability status.
Customer Management: Provides functionalities to add, remove, and update customer information.
Rental Transactions: Facilitates the process of renting and returning cars, while keeping track of rental records.
User Authentication: Implements a login feature that accepts a username and password, with password masking for security.
4. System Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher is required to compile and run the application.
IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as NetBeans or Eclipse is recommended for easier management of files and execution.
Operating System: Compatible with any OS that supports Java (Windows, macOS, Linux).
5. Installation
Clone the Repository: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
Set Up the Project: Open the project in your preferred IDE and set the appropriate project structure.
Compile the Code: Use the IDE’s build feature to compile the project, ensuring all dependencies are resolved.
6. Usage
6.1 Running the Application
Launch the application through the main entry point class. The application will display options for managing cars, customers, and rental transactions.
6.2 User Authentication
Access the login feature to enter a username and password. The system allows three attempts for successful login, providing feedback on incorrect entries.
6.3 Managing Cars and Customers
Users can navigate through the application’s menu to add or modify car and customer information as needed.
7. Testing
It is essential to develop a suite of test cases to validate each component of the system. Unit tests should be created for key functionalities to ensure reliability and correctness.

8. Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to enhance the project are welcome. Interested developers can fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Ensure to follow coding standards and include relevant documentation for any new features.
